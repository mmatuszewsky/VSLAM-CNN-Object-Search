# VSLAM-CNN-Object-Search

## Description
The goal of this project is to develop software for a robot that will enable it to move around a room in a collision-free manner using the VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) algorithm while searching/finding objects using CNN (Nonvolutional Neural Networks). 
Software tests should be carried out both "live" and using simulations. Selection of objects possible through an application specifically designed for this purpose. Examples of applications of such a robot are, for example, assistance to the blind, inspection of dangerous places or places difficult to access for people. 
This solution can also be an important element in the design of a general-purpose intelligent robot.
